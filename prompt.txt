AutoDS is an AI-powered Data Science Agent that automatically transforms raw data into actionable insights, visualizations, and a fully-annotated Jupyter Notebook based on user instructions. The platform must allow users to upload datasets, issue natural language prompts, and receive real-time status updates as AutoDS performs each step of the data science workflow.

The core features and behavioral expectations of AutoDS are:

1. Intelligent Dataset Handling

Allow users to upload tabular datasets (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL datasets, etc.).

Auto-detect data types, missing values, key metrics, and metadata.

Provide an initial summary of the dataset as soon as it is uploaded.

2. Natural Language Interaction

Users can type clear, conversational prompts such as:
“Analyze this dataset and find the top predictors of target.”
“Show distribution plots for all numeric variables.”
“Build a regression model, evaluate it, and explain results.”

AutoDS must interpret instructions and map them to appropriate actions.

3. Real-Time Workflow Execution + Status Updates

The agent should show step-by-step progress status:
“Loading data…” → “Cleaning null values…” → “Generating plots…” → “Training model…” → “Done”.

Provide interactive feedback so the user understands what’s being done.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generate high-quality EDA visuals: histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and more.

Provide textual summaries explaining key insights from the visuals.

5. Modeling & Evaluation

Allow users to trigger ML workflows: classification, regression, clustering, time-series forecasting, etc.

AutoDS should select appropriate algorithms, train models, and display evaluation results (metrics, confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.).

6. Automatic Notebook Generation

Every action AutoDS takes should be recorded as a cleanly organized Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with:
✓ Separate cells for each step (data loading, cleaning, visuals, modeling)
✓ Clear comments and explanations written in natural language
✓ Output visualizations embedded in the notebook

Provide the notebook to the user for download or further editing.

7. Visualization & Insight Interpretation

AutoDS should produce human-readable interpretations of its results, e.g., “This feature is strongly correlated with the target because…”

Visualizations must be high-resolution and customizable.

8. Configurable Output Options

Users should be able to specify:

Target variable

Algorithms to test

Level of detail in explanations

Whether to optimize hyperparameters

9. Reproducibility and Export

Provide downloadable code scripts (Python .py) as well as notebooks.

Include export options for results, visuals, and reports.

10. Modular, Extendable Architecture

The internal workflow engine must support plugin modules for:

Custom algorithms

API integrations

External dashboards

Provide a clean, responsive UI that makes the entire data science process intuitive for users of all skill levels and generate full product documentation and user guides automatically.

UI should be in react based and backend to be in python based.
Use the llm model provider for now Deepinfra and model zai-org/GLM-4.7
it has reasoning and thinking ability
let the real time status update should have the first thinking, planning, todo list, tools callable, execution, verify and fix, 
totally how the ai agent works with full automation
