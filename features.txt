2. "Auto-EDA" Dashboard Mode 🚀
One-click Exploratory Data Analysis.

Feature: A sidebar button "Generate Report".
AI Action: Automatically scans the CSV, detects numerical/categorical columns, and generates a full HTML report (Distribution plots, Correlation Matrix, Missing Data heatmap) instantly.
Benefit: Saves the user 20 minutes of initial inspection work.

3. Database Connectors (Real-world Usage) 🔗
Real data usually lives in SQL, not just CSVs.
Feature: A "Connect DB" modal (Postgres/MySQL/SQLite).
AI Action: The AI can query the schema (SHOW TABLES), write SQL queries instead of Pandas, and join tables for you.
Benefit: Makes the tool usable for backend engineers and business analysts.

4. Comparison Memory (RAG) 🧠
Feature: "Compare this result with the sales data from last week."
AI Action: Since we now have session_history files, we can index them. The AI can read past JSON files to answer cross-session questions.
Benefit: True "Assistant" capability, remembering context over time.

5. Secure Sandboxed Execution 🛡️
Feature: Replace 
exec()
 with a real Jupyter Kernel or Docker container.
Benefit: Safety. Prevents the AI from accidentally deleting files or hanging the server. Essential if you ever host this online.
