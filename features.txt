2. "Auto-EDA" Dashboard Mode 🚀
One-click Exploratory Data Analysis.

Feature: A sidebar button "Generate Report".
AI Action: Automatically scans the CSV, detects numerical/categorical columns, and generates a full HTML report (Distribution plots, Correlation Matrix, Missing Data heatmap) instantly.
Benefit: Saves the user 20 minutes of initial inspection work.

3. Database Connectors (Real-world Usage) 🔗
Real data usually lives in SQL, not just CSVs.
Feature: A "Connect DB" modal (Postgres/MySQL/SQLite).
AI Action: The AI can query the schema (SHOW TABLES), write SQL queries instead of Pandas, and join tables for you.
Benefit: Makes the tool usable for backend engineers and business analysts.

4. Comparison Memory (RAG) 🧠
Feature: "Compare this result with the sales data from last week."
AI Action: Since we now have session_history files, we can index them. The AI can read past JSON files to answer cross-session questions.
Benefit: True "Assistant" capability, remembering context over time.


5. Comparison Memory (RAG) 🧠
Feature: "Compare this result with the sales data from last week."
AI Action: Index session history using `sentence-transformers` (Local & Free). Semantic search retrives relevant past context.
Benefit: True "Assistant" capability, remembering context over time.

6. Smart Data Cleaning Pipeline 🧹
Feature: One-click "Sanitize Data".
AI Action: Auto-detects schema, fixes encoding, imputes missing values (KNN/Mean), normalizes dates, and removes duplicates.
Benefit: "Garbage in, garbage out" - this ensures high-quality analysis.


7. Automated Feature Engineering 🏗️
Feature: "Create new features for better accuracy."
AI Action: Automatically generates interaction terms, polynomial features, and datetime components (DayOfWeek, IsWeekend).
Benefit: Improves model performance without manual column creation.

8. Explainable AI (XAI) 🔍
Feature: "Why did the model predict this?"
AI Action: Integrate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to visualize feature contribution.
Benefit: Black-box models become interpretable (Trustworthy AI).

9. Statistical Hypothesis Testing 🧪
Feature: "Is the difference significant?"
AI Action: Auto-run T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests based on data types.
Benefit: Scientifically rigorous validation of insights.
